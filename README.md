Group Capstone - Retrospective

What went well:

I really enjoyed working in this project and working in this group was very good. I believe that we have communicated a lot during the whole project and we were to discuss certain aspects of the project that helped guiding us. One more thing that was very good to work with my colleagues was that when I was having some questions and issues during the automation part, all 3 members of the group tried to assist me.
I also liked how we handled the video part. We decided that each one would be recording their own videos and in the end they would send it to me in order to merge them all together. It was a very “easy” project to do when you have good teammates.


What went wrong:

I think for me what went wrong was the automation part of the project. First of all I was having a lot of issues to even start typing the code. I was having some issues with the Visual Studio and I had to ask Dre for assistance. After we were able to figure that part out, I started to have issues on the coding itself. I tried to copy some class examples we had and the system would always give me a really hard time to run.
When I was very worried and starting to “give up”, the code, suddenly, started to work. It was a big blessing when that happened and it made me keep working and I was able to test everything I was planning.


Testing outcomes:

As a group we were able to test the website that we chose. We were able to test some of the features and sections that the website have and we have not encountered any issues or bugs (at least I did not find anything on the sections I have tested. About the sections I have tested I believe they are working in a satisfactory manner and the sections have passed my tests.
